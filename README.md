☕ Java Projects Repository
📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed as part of university coursework. The projects focus on core programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, file I/O, and graphical user interfaces using both Swing and JavaFX.

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates problem-solving, object-oriented design, and custom data structure implementation.

📂 Projects Included
🎯 1. 20 Questions Game (Swing)

An interactive 20 Questions-style guessing game powered by a binary decision tree.

✨ Key Features

GUI built with JOptionPane

Binary tree of yes/no questions

Tree expands dynamically when the program guesses incorrectly

Option to save learned knowledge to a file

Recursive tree traversal for saving/loading data

🧠 Concepts Used

Binary trees

Recursion

File I/O

Object-oriented programming

Swing GUI

📘 2. Course Contents Manager (JavaFX)

A JavaFX desktop application that displays course information and prioritizes assignments.

✨ Key Features

View courses, assignments, midterms, and finals

Assignments sorted by due date and weight

Data loaded from a structured text file

Simple, clean GUI with buttons and text output

🧩 Custom Data Structures

Linked List

Dictionary (key–value store)

Priority Queue

All data structures are implemented from scratch (no Java Collections Framework).

🧠 Concepts Used

JavaFX

Custom data structures

File parsing

Comparable interface

Modular application design

🧮 3. Data Structures Coursework

A set of projects and assignments covering:

Arrays & complexity analysis

Linked lists

Dictionaries

Binary trees

Each assignment emphasizes hands-on implementation and algorithmic thinking.

🛠️ 4. Supporting Utilities

Reusable components used across multiple projects:

Generic node classes

Key–value pair structures

Queue nodes

Enums for assignment types

These utilities help maintain clean architecture and code reuse.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Java 11+

JavaFX

Swing

File I/O

Object-Oriented Programming

Custom data structure implementations

▶️ How to Run

Compile and run individual projects from their respective main classes

JavaFX project requires JavaFX to be properly configured

Input files must remain in expected paths (e.g., data/contents.txt)

🎓 Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms

Practical GUI development in Java

Recursive problem solving

Clean separation of concerns

Writing maintainable, modular Java code
