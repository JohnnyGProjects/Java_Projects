Java Projects Repository
Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed as part of university coursework. The projects focus on core programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, file I/O, and graphical user interfaces using both Swing and JavaFX.

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates problem-solving, object-oriented design, and custom data structure implementation.

Projects Included
1. 20 Questions Game (Swing)

An interactive 20 Questions-style guessing game using a binary decision tree.

Key Features

GUI built with JOptionPane

Binary tree of yes/no questions

Tree expands dynamically when the program guesses incorrectly

Ability to save learned knowledge to a file

Recursive tree traversal for saving/loading game data

Concepts Used

Binary trees

Recursion

File I/O

Object-oriented design

Swing GUI

2. Course Contents Manager (JavaFX)

A JavaFX desktop application that displays course information and prioritizes assignments.

Key Features

Displays courses, assignments, midterms, and finals

Assignments sorted by due date and weight

Data loaded from a structured text file

Simple GUI with buttons and text area output

Custom Data Structures

Linked List

Dictionary (key–value store)

Priority Queue

All data structures are implemented from scratch (no Java Collections Framework).

Concepts Used

JavaFX

Custom data structures

File parsing

Comparable interface

Modular design

3. Data Structures Coursework

Projects and assignments covering:

Arrays and complexity analysis

Linked lists

Dictionaries

Binary trees

Includes practical implementations tied to real-world examples and applications.

4. Supporting Utilities

Reusable components used across projects:

Generic nodes

Key–value pairs

Queue nodes

Enums for assignment types

These support clean separation of logic and extensibility.

Technologies Used

Java 11+

JavaFX

Swing

File I/O

Object-Oriented Programming

Custom data structure implementations

How to Run

Compile and run individual projects from their respective main classes

JavaFX project requires JavaFX properly configured

Input files must remain in expected paths (e.g., data/contents.txt)

Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms

Practical GUI development in Java

Recursive problem solving

Clean separation of concerns

Writing maintainable, modular Java code
